- Abstract classes can have `implementations` for some of its members, but interfaces cannot.
- Abstract classes can have `fields`, but interfaces cannot.
- Abstract classes can inherit from `interface` or `abstract class`, but interface can only inherit from `interface`.
- A class can inherit `multiple interfaces`, but only `one class`.
- Abstract classes can have `access modifiers`, but interfaces cannot.
