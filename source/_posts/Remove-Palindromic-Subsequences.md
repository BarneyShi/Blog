**`Note:`**
- Because you can remove incontiguous chars, so if s is a palindrome string, return 1, otherwise return 2.

**`Question:`**

You are given a string s consisting `only of letters 'a' and 'b'`. In a single step you can remove one palindromic `subsequence` from s.

Return the `minimum` number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a `subsequence` of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called `palindrome` if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

**`Example:`**
```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.
```

**`Code:`**
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var removePalindromeSub = function(s) {
  if (isPalindrome(s)) return 1;
  return 2;

  function isPalindrome(str) {
    let left = 0, right = str.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
      if (str[left] !== str[right]) return false;
      left++;
      right--;
    }
    return true;
  }
};
```
