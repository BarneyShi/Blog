**`Note:`**
- First, we need to list all `atomic` roman numbers, including variant like `900, 90, 40...`.
- For example, we list 90 instead of 80 is that 90 can be expressed as `XC`, but 80 is not `XXC` but `LXXX`.
- While `num` is not 0, minus it with the `biggest atmoic roman num` available.
- Keep doing this till num is 0.

**`Question:`**

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**`Example:`**
```
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
```

**`Code:`**
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {string}
 */
 var intToRoman = function(num) {
  const pairs = [[1000, 'M'], [900, 'CM'], [500, 'D'], [400, 'CD'], [100, 'C'], [90, 'XC'], [50, 'L'], [40, 'XL'], [10, 'X'], [9, 'IX'], [5, 'V'], [4, 'IV'], [1, 'I']];
  let res = '';
  while (num !== 0) {
    for (const [key, val] of pairs) {
      while (num >= key) {
        res += val;
        num -= key;
      }
    }
  }
  return res;
};
```
