**`Note:`**
-`DP` (Slow)
  - `dp[i]` means the min steps from `index 0` to `index i`.
  - For each `i` we need to find the min dp value between `[0, i-1]` and add `1` to it.

- `Greedy`
  - How to be greedy? Always take next step that can `go furthest from there`.

Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

**Example**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**`DP O(n^2)`** 
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var jump = function(nums) {
  let dp = [...Array(nums.length).fill(Infinity)];
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (i <= nums[j] + j) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[nums.length - 1];
};
```

**`DP O(n)`**
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var jump = function(nums) {
  let start = 0;
  // Don't initialize `end` to `nums[0]`, you don't know if nums[0] is bigger than nums.length - 1.
  let end = 0;
  let ans = 0;
  while (end < nums.length - 1) {
    let tmp = 0;
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
      tmp = Math.max(tmp, nums[i] + i);
    }
    // Don't update `start` as `i` (The index of biggest tmp) because in that way we'll iterate elements after `i` more than one.
    start = end + 1;
    end = tmp;
    ans++;
  }
  return ans;
};
```
