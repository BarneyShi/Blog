**`Note:`**
- Because of the time complexity requirement, we can know we must use `binary search`
- The direction of moving `left, right` pointers depends on where the pivot is, there are two situations:

  - We can check the pos of pivot by comparing `left` with `middle`.
- Only by checking `nums[middle] > target` is not enough.
  - For example: ![img](https://i.imgur.com/zW55TqT.png)
  - Both of these two pos of target meet `nums[m] > target`.
  - We need to compare `target` with `left/right` as well.
  
**`Question:`**

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k (1 <= k < nums.length)` such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array `nums` `after` the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or `-1` if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**`Example:`**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**`Code:`**
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
 var search = function(nums, target) {
  let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    if (nums[right] === target) return right;
    if (nums[left] === target) return left;
    let middle = ~~((left + right) / 2);
    if (nums[middle] === target) return middle;
    
    if (nums[left] <= nums[middle]) {
      if (nums[middle] > target && nums[left] < target) {
        right = middle - 1;
        continue;
      } else {
        left = middle + 1;
        continue;
      }
    } else if (nums[left] > nums[middle]) {
      if (nums[middle] < target && nums[right] > target) {
        left = middle + 1;
        continue;
      } else {
        right = middle - 1;
        continue;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
  return -1;
};
```
